## Hi Everyone!!! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Patrick and I am a high school computer science and techology teacher.
I'm currently working on updating my coding courses for the upcoming school year (2024/25).
I'm currently learning how to code spheros, arduinos and raspberry pi.

I am a big sports fan and music fan.
